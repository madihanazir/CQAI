This project implements a diffusion model that generates images based on input entries. The web interface is built using Streamlit, and the project leverages the Pillow library for image processing and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

 User Input: Enter a description or parameters to guide the image generation.
 
 Image Generation: Generate images using a diffusion model.
 
 Visualization: Display generated images with Matplotlib.
 
 Save Images: Save generated images locally.
